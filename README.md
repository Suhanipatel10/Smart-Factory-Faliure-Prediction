# Smart Factory Filure Prediction

‚öôÔ∏è Smart Factory Failure Predictor (Streamlit App)
A simple and intelligent machine failure prediction web app built using Streamlit and a trained Random Forest model. It simulates predictive maintenance in a smart factory setting using real-time inputs from sensors like Torque, Tool Wear, Temperature, and Rotational Speed.

**1. Purpose**
This project simulates a Smart Factory environment where machine failure is predicted in advance using sensor data. It supports predictive maintenance by:

Minimizing unplanned downtime

Alerting operators before critical failure

Explaining which parameters lead to breakdowns

Useful for internships and jobs related to:

Smart Factory / Industry 4.0

Business Intelligence / Manufacturing Analytics

Predictive Maintenance Engineer

Data Science in Industrial IoT

**7. Inference & Business Value**
Torque and Tool Wear are often the strongest predictors of machine failure.

High rotational speed combined with tool fatigue increases failure risk.

Helps factories switch from reactive to predictive maintenance.

Reduces unexpected breakdowns, saving cost and improving uptime.

Model performance (ROC-AUC = 0.98) indicates strong reliability in production use.
